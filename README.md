# SR-ResCNN
A Keras implementation of a Super-Resolution Residual Convolutional Neural Network.

The goal is to obtain a network that successfully increase the resolution of an image by filling the gaps in a manner that outperforms the generic "bicubic" method.

# Warning
This is still a Work In Progress. Do not expect this to work.

For future reference (to myself), build a proper README.md with [this](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You will need a virtual environment that contains the following packages:

```
tensorflow
numpy
matplotlib
skimage
keras
```

## Built With
